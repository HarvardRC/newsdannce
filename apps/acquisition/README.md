# Acquire footage from a DANNCE rig

## Options for acquisition

**Suggestion**: use campy for camera recording

1. Campy ([link to repo](https://github.com/ksseverson57/campy))
   - CLI tool
   - Original solution for DANNCE
   - Python-based tool to sync cameras, acquire footage, and transcode footage

2. Bonsai ([link to repo](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/bonsai))
   - GUI tool
   - Issue with compression as of 11/10/24
   - Used by Tim's lab video 
   - May allow increased FPS for transcoding? Unverified
   - Uses same FFMPEG string as campy
